# hrefs

This repo stores a [collection of links to other webpages](https://github.com/hrefs/hrefs/blob/master/links.md).

## Purpose

There's a lot of crap on the Web, and sifting through it all to find the gems is hard.
This repo serves as a cache of good stuff. I could always bookmark pages, I suppose,
but linking to them here has the advantage that the list is public and I can access it
from anywhere without signing into anything.

## Scope

Links that go here must meet the following criteria:

- Lasting relevance. Memes, tweets, and news articles tend to have a
  short sell-by date and aren't the kinds of things I want to bookmark indefinitely.
- Public access. I.e. they shouldn't require sign-in, download, or purchase to get to
  the interesting content.
